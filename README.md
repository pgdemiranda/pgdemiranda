## Hello there,

My name is Pablo Gomes de Miranda, 

I am looking for professional opportunities as a Data Scientist, especially where I can help companies make decisions that will lead to positive results through the use of Data.
I have a bachelor's and a master's degree in History and a doctorate in Religious Studies with an international internship and experience in research and teaching in the Humanities.I have previous experience working as a History teacher in high school and as an adjunct professor in college lecturing about Ancient and Medieval History.

To this moment, I am still developing my studies in the various tools used in Data Science, including some necessary projects seeking to implement this knowledge while building a portfolio. 

I believe that my long experience in Education and History has given me good communication skills as well as the necessary competencies to present unconventional solutions in the field of Data Science.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/pgdemiranda/rossmann-sales)
This is a Sales Forecasting project in which we propose the sales prediction of a European pharmaceutical company, Dirk Rossmann GmbH. The data was collected via Kaggle from the Rossmann Store Sales competition. After an exploratory data analysis and the use of an algorithm called boruta to select the best features for a prediction using a XGBoost Regressor Machine Learning model, we have achieved an average prediction of sales of **â‚¬285,338,016.00** for the next six weeks and implemented the solution in a way that is easily accessible for the company's business team.

Tools used:
1. Python 3.9.13
2. VS Code
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Heroku: Cloud Application Platform
5. Telegram Messenger

## Data Analysis:

### [Insights Project](https://github.com/pgdemiranda/house_rocket)
This is an *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* project whose objectives are to generate insights to answer two simple questions asked by 
a fictitious real estate company: given a list of properties:

1. which ones should be acquired and 
2. what are the sales conditions to obtain the highest profit.

Tools used:
1. Python 3.9.13
2. VS Code
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Streamlit
5. Streamlit Community Cloud

We answered both questions by delivering two csv files containing a list of 157 properties that can be acquired at a reasonable price by the company and sold in different seasons making a good profit. If House Rocket acquire and sell all the suggested properties, it can be expected a total profit of **US$24222890.20**
